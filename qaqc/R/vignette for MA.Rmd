This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Meta-analysis is used to synthesize the available trait data and give out posterior parameter estimates of plant traits which are going to be used in anecosystem model.
Individual Meta-analysis
##'  Individual meta-analysis for a specific trait and PFT is run by the function
##' single.MA. This will allow power analysis  to run repeated MA outside of the
##' full loop over traits and PFTs. 
```{r}
library(devtools)
document("modules/meta.analysis")
test("modules/meta.analysis")
library(PEcAn.utils)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
